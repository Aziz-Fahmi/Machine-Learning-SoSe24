Machine Learning Projects
1. Meta Platforms Utility Function Modeling
   
This project explores the relationship between Meta Platforms' (formerly Facebook) total assets and monthly active users (MAU) from 2008 to 2023. The main goal is to determine the best model to predict Meta's total assets based on MAU.
Two predictive models are compared:

Linear Regression: Assumes a linear relationship between MAU and total assets.

Metcalfe Utility Function: Models the network effect, where the value of the platform increases quadratically with the number of users, reflecting network dynamics.

The project examines how these models capture Meta’s valuation mechanisms and how they relate to the economic principle of diminishing marginal utility, offering insights into how the platform's value evolves as its user base grows.

2. Solar-Thermal Water Heating System Performance Analysis
   
This project focuses on analyzing and improving the performance of a solar-thermal water heating system in an apartment building. The system supports space heating and water heating through solar energy, supplemented by a gas condensing boiler when solar energy is insufficient.

Key goals include:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): To identify the number of key components needed to predict gas consumption effectively.

Essential Variables: To determine which variables (sunshine duration, outdoor temperature, solar yield, etc.) significantly impact gas consumption.

Linear Regression: To predict gas consumption based on the principal components derived from measured variables.

By using PCA and regression analysis, the project aims to optimize the heating system’s performance and provide insights into operational efficiency.
